# What is Compcodicons?

Compcodicons is a specialist icon font set for competitive coding / programming. It contains icons for websites and organistions related to competitive coding and programming that are often missing from mainstream repositories. 

Basically, it is an amateurish rip-off from [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) for Competitive Coding.

# Usage 

Install Compcodicons on your site by placing the fonts and css folders on your server and link to the compcodicons.css stylesheet by adding the following to the page header:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/folder/css/compcodicons.css"/>
```

Call the icons via

```html
<i class="cci cci-hackerrank"></i>
```
